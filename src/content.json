Though that was my title, on top of my coding React components and Managing Redux state, I did Mockups, UX design, and created all the icons for this App. Also worth noting my photoshop skills came in handy many times for quick turn arounds when images provided by Artist did not meet the coding requirements. My main patches of pride are the universal image component I made and the multi-teir filtering system ",

As I mentored under an amazing technical artist I expanded my skillset from Modeling and texturing to include Python Tool Creation, Pipeline Flow and Rigging for 3d animation. Here I made a Maya Modeling Toolset with custom tools, exporters. Sims was a well oiled machine. I learned project structures and naming conventions that can make any project run smooth.",
